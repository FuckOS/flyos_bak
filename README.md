## Installation

1. Install [termux](http://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)and open
2. Enter in Termux: `curl -L http://flyosgeek.com/gosetup.sh | bash` and press Enter

## Quick start
FlyOS is based on Termux, it should be easy to use and quick to start, but it can't. It's awful.

After the installation is complete, reopen it, it will become unavailable and bring you to your favorite browser(e.g. Internet Explorer). The configuration can be completed. After the configuration is successful, FlyOS will shut down or start automatically. (It depends on your fortune. )After the configuration is complete, it is simple and easy to use, and can understand a little level (development for junior high school students, I believe your level is worse than me, because, I, Xing Y.J. ,is better than anyone. )

## Is FlyOS a system? Why is there an os? 

Some people say that FlyOS is not a kind of operating system. Here, I'm gonna say: Yes! It isn't an operating system! You are right! How clever you are! Why not consider joining our organization to develop it since you are so clever!
